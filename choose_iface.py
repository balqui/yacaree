THIS FILE SHOULD BE INNECESSARY BY NOW AND IS REMOVED FROM VERSION CONTROL

It was employed to choose text interface or GUI up to around v1.2.2.
By now the way to choose the GUI is calling with the flag -g upon
launching python yacaree.py (whether Python 2 or Python 3, depends
on the version you are looking at).

It remains a bit unclear at this point how to handle this on Windows
as I no longer have such a machine. Formerly, there was a way to 
launch the GUI by double-clicking on the yacaree.py file.

Earlier info:

uncomment desired line - as of today, only GUI works,
plan is to add iface to the statics and also to move up to argparse

former comment:
it does not work smoothly yet, to run by double-clicking one must use the GUI

but as of today it does not run at all by double-clicking

##from iface_TEXT import * ## for text output through Python console

##from iface import * ## for the Tk GUI, only for launching yacaree.py
