Do not use this version 1.2.0 of yacaree, unless you know what 
you are doing.

Most users are welcome thus far to download and use version 1.1.

Version 1.2 will manage implications of confidence 1, which previous
versions do not; version 1.2.0 is an alpha version to be tested by 
the developing team and their friends. If you use it, first, tell 
us, then, expect anything, and, finally, tell us what happened.

For the rest of the readme, refer to README-V11.txt, thank you.
