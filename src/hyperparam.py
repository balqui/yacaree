Heavily simplified as the refactoring reaches the sophisticated algorithms.

CAVEAT: Still requires some work.

Current quandary: mode in hpar is a Python string, mode in IFace 
is a Tk StringVar(), and they have to be in lockstep: change is
effected in IFace but consequences are to be guided from hpar.

I see two options: a/ manage to bind hpar.mode to the radio buttons, 
but for this I need it to be a Tk StringVar, whose creation requires
previous existence of a Tk() which is created in IFace.go() which also
launches the run: too late for setting up the mode; b/ import somehow 
the IFace field inside hpar but unclear then how to entangle them.

Evolution of earlier module encompassing some static objects 
accessed from everywhere (or: Singleton pattern implemented 
as a module; spoiler: did not work well enough).

verbose: echo all log entries to terminal - UNCLEAR

confthr: was about 2/3 for long, scaled; set at 0.6 for somedays, not convincing, settling for 0.65 for v1.1
(natural alternatives to consider: 3/4 and 4/5) - TO STAY

maxrules: number of rules to be output, max boost among those found - DOUBTFUL, NOT IMPLEMENTED CURRENTLY

genabsupp: Do not consider closures with absolute support below this - TO STAY
