CAVEAT: Must simplify a lot the docstrings and clean up the code.

Careful: a hash is defined to use ItSet's as set members and 
dict keys; ItSet should be handled always as immutable even though
the program does not control that instances don't change.

Consider migrating it into a frozen dataclass - TRIED but couldn't
make it work, see file in scaff folder.

A simplified version might be handy where we only keep contents 
and supp, forgetting supportset and suppratio once they have 
fulfilled their roles.

History:

Programmed as
class ItSet(frozenset) 
until Nivose 2025.

Itemsets were frozensets so that they can index dicts;
initially they had supp, later moved off to a dict in Lattice.
(12/2024) Unclear what difference is relevant beyond a custom
__str__ but will keep the class around anyhow for the time being.

(Jan/2025)
Next goal is to use them, essentially, as heap elements so that
the standard heapq library can be employed at face falue, thus
getting rid of FlHeap and yaFlHeap.
For this, they need to include their own support and also a
tie-breaking component to make sure that the heap never compares
the sets themselves.
First idea was to change the sign of the support so that the heaps
work as max-heaps but current decision is to hide that into custom
comparisons.
Moreover, we need to compare ItSets according to two orderings,
support-based for the heap and mere subset order. We customize
"<" as support-based order for the heap but leave "<=" inherited
from frozenset so that it has the standard meaning. At some point
in time I had customized instead the "shift" operator "<<" to mean 
subset-or-equal but not anymore.

Also: inheriting from frozenset does not work, since init requires
two parameters but somehow the instantiation mandates only one and
both one and two parameters raise errors. (Probably something to
do with __new__, maybe will try to find out some day.)

In Lattice I need to intersect ItSet's and use the outcome to index
a dict. I could give ItSet an intersect method but it would have to
construct unions of the lists of transactions, and it is unclear 
that this is needed. For the time being, I take them down to frozensets
at the time of intersecting.

Old:

def __init__(self, contents=[], supp = float("inf")):
    frozenset.__init__(self, contents)
    did not work with Python 2 nor 3, and
    super().__init__(self, contents)
    did not work either.
    Programmed as
    self = frozenset(contents)

def __str__(self):
    prettyprint of itemset: CAVEAT: add support if nonzero?
    return "{ " + ', '.join( str(trad[el]) if el in trad else str(el)
                          for el in sorted(self) ) + " }"
if __name__=="__main__":
    print(ItSet(range(5)))

Had a version in @dataclass form, but required looking up
the contents field to operate and I decided to get back to
inheriting from set (try not no use frozensets initially
as they are no longer to index the supports dict in lattice...
but they index other dict's and belong to other set's).
