** ToDo for 1.1:

after icde submission:

changes already made to rule.py, version 1.0 conserved separately
- add one space near support at the output
- report the leverage of the rules as well

small corrections to do: 
- mention actual confidence threshold upon reporting at the end (done)
- mention yacaree version in the main screen (done)
- disable the dataset load button while computing (done)
- set at 0.6 the default confidence threshold (done, not sure good idea)

running yaflheap alone raises exception

reduce the cboost only if the weighted average with lifts is _clearly_ lower, say by 0.001 (done)

rename mineclosures to mine_closures in ClMiner

clarify the support ratio of the positive border

make it report a bit more often along the way (done, I think, but not yet clear how) - get periodic reporting as a function of time (say once per minute at least)

support sorting may make more sense!,

report confidence boost reached all along and also that of the 50 rules (or whatever) reported

** ToDo for 1.2:

use the processing of singletons to get full implications with antec size 1 and implement their cboost

** ToDo for 1.2 or 1.3:

get the whole GD basis

allow rules with negated items

enable a "retry" button leading to options such as
- choose either 50 rules or all of them
- demanding / loose settings (of what?, conf 0.51 maybe, cboost 1 absolute and initial maybe...)

** Further issues to work on and/or clarify:

I set for a test both abs and initial boost at 1 and got exactly one rule of boost 1, can this be? think!

solve the issue of the "two borders" and the support ratio near the threshold
(I am not getting principal => component and component => analysis due to that)

transform and check the eprints 2009 dataset

transform and check cover type

check elearning datasets
