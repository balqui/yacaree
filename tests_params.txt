lenses          2              3            3        harsh good, supp 15 no change, strict a bit better, lenient no difference

connect         0              0            0        finds nothing, latt border still at inf for all three
                                                     no change at supp 15 for harsh
                                                     needs first cut at maybe 60 (then mem full w/ maybe an additional 1GB of swap)

chess           0              0            1        mild very slow, both memory and heap grow slowly, stringent still slow
                                                     latt border still at inf in both (thus the 0's), empty-an rule at lenient
                                                     harsh w supp 15 no change

papersTr       10             49           79        nothing relevant lost from mild to stringent but s/t lost for harsh
                                                     harsh w supp 15 recovers a bit for 21 but still s/t missed
                                                     stringent looks good, some (not many) lowish boost in mild interesting

NOW             0              4           45        harsh w supp 15 no change, strict good 4 but a bit too little, lenient good

votesTr         0              2         2383        harsh w supp 15 no change, strict good 2 but a bit insuf, lenient overwhelms

cmc            19             87         2153        19 reasonably good, grow to 27 at supp 15 but no real growth in interest 
                                                     extra ones at stringent are good (some, not too many), lenient overwhelms
                                                     many rules for specific values of "age" and/or "children so far"

adultrain      55             99         1398        harsh good enough, supp 15 no change, lenient overwhelms
                                                     stringent brings in a few good ones but 99 is maybe too many
                                                     quite a few rules with "age:..." or "hours_per_week:..."


Morals: 

 - keep harsh at supp 25 because drop to 15 only makes changes where harsh is not very good
 - may need a variant of lenient with stricter mult improv (but clarify what for)


==

As of March 16, only testing the latest version of ruleminer on a 16GB machine.
 - chess OK (very slow, both memory and heap grow slowly) 
   (produces only empty antecedents, currently only one but thats OK)
   (skip trying 1.2/1.2/10)
 - papersTr OK, 70 rules, good enough
   1.2/1.2/10: 49 (no echo nada en falta)
 - connect OK, finds nothing, latt border still at inf after mem full 
   and an additional 1GB of swap 
   1.2/1.2/10: nothing found (OK)
   (strong effect on memory, suppose via suppratio, then longish time)
 - NOW OK, 250 rules
   1.2/1.2/10: 4 rules
 - votesTr OK, 1088 rules
   1.2/1.2/10: 2 quite good rules
   (w/ suppratio at 1.2 2 rules, at 1.15 13 rules)
 - cmc (full) OK, no support incr, 1325 rules, suppratio 1.2 472 rules, at cboo 1.25 179 rules
   many rules for specific values of "age" and/or "children so far"
   (w/ additional cut abs supp 10: 45 rules, abs sup 20: 21 rules)
   1.2/1.2/10: 87 rules, good enough but 1.25 seems better
 - adultrain OK, 950 rules, try 1.2/1.2/10 99 rules good enough
 - lenses 3 quite good rules, 1.2/1.2/10 same
 
MUST TRY 1.25/1.25/10 Y 1.25/1.25/20.
MUST TRY NOW restricted to order-family omitting genus-species
(and other options like only order or order-family-genus omitting species)
(count indets on each!) 

compute 0.668/0.659 ~ 1.013 < 1.05
