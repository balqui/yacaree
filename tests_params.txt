Morals: 

 - keep harsh at supp 25 because drop to 15 only makes changes where harsh is not very good
 - end up with four levels although the difference is often very high between 1.2/1.2/15 and 1.15/1.05/10
 
Try 1.15/1.10/10 instead for lenient: adultrain 480, cmc 230, votes 89 (goodish!), NOW 5, papers 48, chess 0, connect 0, lenses 3.
Try 1.15/1.15/10 instead for lenient: adultrain 235, cmc 201, votes 13 (goodish), NOW 5, papers 46, chess 0, connect 0, lenses 3.
Try 1.15/1.15/5 instead for lenient: adultrain 235, cmc 726, votes 13, NOW 28, papers 35, chess 0, connect 0, lenses 3.

Middle one is best: 1.15/1.15/10

Try 1.1/1.1/5 instead for relaxed: adultrain 682, cmc 1878, votes 204, NOW 45, papers 42, chess 0, connect 0, lenses 3.

==

As of March 16, only testing the latest version of ruleminer on a 16GB machine.
 - chess OK (very slow, both memory and heap grow slowly) 
   (produces only empty antecedents, currently only one but thats OK)
   (skip trying 1.2/1.2/10)
 - papersTr OK, 70 rules, good enough
   1.2/1.2/10: 49 (no echo nada en falta)
 - connect OK, finds nothing, latt border still at inf after mem full 
   and an additional 1GB of swap 
   1.2/1.2/10: nothing found (OK)
   (strong effect on memory, suppose via suppratio, then longish time)
 - NOW OK, 250 rules
   1.2/1.2/10: 4 rules
 - votesTr OK, 1088 rules
   1.2/1.2/10: 2 quite good rules
   (w/ suppratio at 1.2 2 rules, at 1.15 13 rules)
 - cmc (full) OK, no support incr, 1325 rules, suppratio 1.2 472 rules, at cboo 1.25 179 rules
   many rules for specific values of "age" and/or "children so far"
   (w/ additional cut abs supp 10: 45 rules, abs sup 20: 21 rules)
   1.2/1.2/10: 87 rules, good enough but 1.25 seems better
 - adultrain OK, 950 rules, try 1.2/1.2/10 99 rules good enough
 - lenses 3 quite good rules, 1.2/1.2/10 same
 
MUST TRY 1.25/1.25/10 Y 1.25/1.25/20.
MUST TRY NOW restricted to order-family omitting genus-species
(and other options like only order or order-family-genus omitting species)
(count indets on each!) 

compute 0.668/0.659 ~ 1.013 < 1.05
